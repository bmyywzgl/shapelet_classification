Shapelet based classification algorithm for time series data, inspired by: 
Ye, L. and Keogh, E., Time series shapelets: a new primitive for data mining Proceedings of the 15th ACM SIGKDD international conference on Knowledge discovery and data mining, 2009, 
Based on the classifications from:
Huppenkothen, D., Heil, L. M., Hogg, D. W., & Müller, A. (2017). Exploring the Long-Term Evolution of GRS 1915+105. Monthly Notices of the Royal Astronomical Society, 466, 2364–2377. https://doi.org/10.1093/mnras/stw3190.
